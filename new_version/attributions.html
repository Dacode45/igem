      <h2>2015 Team Members</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Blake</h4>
          <p>Blake was responsible for ensuring that our team was on track to fulfill iGEM requirements. In lab, he worked with Mike to design and build the sgRNA sequences needed for our CRISPR/dCas9 knockdowns. He also was also responsible for carrying out the inductions needed for part characterization, for both our collaboration and our individual team’s part characterization requirement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>David</h4>
          <p>David was the WashU/Penn State iGEM Team’s Wiki Coordinator, designed and implemented our 2015 website. He worked with Charlotte in order to create our overexpression plasmids and our minimal nif plasmids in the lab.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Charlotte</h4>
          <p>Charlotte coordinated the policy and practices portion of our iGEM team, a public discussion panel on GMOs. She worked with David on the effort to build our overexpression plasmids and our minimal nif plasmids. Additionally, she helped with BioBrick construction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Mike</h4>
          <p>Mike helped pull together the funds we needed to pay stipends and send our members to Boston. In the lab, he and Blake helped design and construct sgRNA sequences and was involved in building and testing BioBrick parts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Laura</h4>
          <p>Laura was on the part of our team that looked at genetic interventions and media supplements that might increase nitrogen-fixation in E. coli. She and Jessica worked with computer models trying to identify ways to up or downregulate reactions critical to nitrogen fixation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Jessica</h4>
          <p>Jessica worked on the genome-scale modeling and flux balance analysis that our team did in order to increase the efficiency of nitrogen fixation in E. coli. She worked with Laura, identifying ways to increase concentrations of reactants needed by nitrogenase.</p>
