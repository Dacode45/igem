I had the opportunity to work with Laura, who was very helpful in explaining the scripts we were running. Tom was also able to send me information on python and unix commands, so navigating through these programs was easier than expected.

Our data supports that knocking out either of these reactions individually has little to no effect on the flux through the corresponding reaction, or on the flux through the pyruvate synthase reaction. Research shows that pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency has been associated with a buildup of lactic acid in the cell. The enzyme has also been identified for its essential role in initiating the series of reactions that make up the TCA cycle. According to a study conducted by Anderson ME, Marshall of RT JFood Safety in 1990, increased concentrations of organic acids have been shown to reduce cellular activity in E. coli, leading to higher levels of population reduction. As for the pyruvate formate lyase reaction, one study examined the effects of knocking out it’s associated enzyme on the yield of butanediol in a strain of E. coli known as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Even though the yield was 92.2% of it’ theoretical value, mutant growth was slightly reduced to the parental strain. Similar studies on other mutants of E. coli suggest that this growth deficiency is due to a redox imbalance rather than a reduced level of acetyl­coA. These findings would eliminate the possibility of knocking out either of these reactions from the model.</p><p>Laura was in the process of researching the malate oxidase reaction, which had higher flux ranges for the N2 model over the WT model (contrary to depressed metabolism in the initial).
